In this post, I will describe a technique I have been developing at [Kunumi](https://kunumi.ai) to explain the output of Deep Neural Networks trained to solve NLP tasks.

By the end of this post, you will have learned:

- Deep Neural Networks in NLP
- Explanation methods in Deep Neural Networks
- Interpreting the gradient explanations in Deep NLP Networks

## Deep Neural Networks in Natural Language Processing

## Explaining the output of a Deep Neural Network

## Gradient explanations in NLP

## Demo: turning positive movie reviews into negative (and vice-versa)
